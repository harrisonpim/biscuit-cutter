# Recommendations

- Use [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to clean up the outputs of your notebooks
- Use [dotenv-stripout](https://github.com/harrisonpim/dotenv-stripout/) to share the necessary environment variables for running your code, without revealing the sensitive values themselves.
- Use the [jupyterlab_code_formatter](https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter) extension (installed by default) to autoformat code blocks in your notebooks
